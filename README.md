# CarX RCN
Real Car Names for CarX

## Name Override
You can override any names provided by the mod by creating a file called `rcn_override.json` next to the game exe then put the following inside.

```json
{
  "Ktisune": "NSX",
  "Black Fox": "It's too loud"
}
```

Just keep in mind that if you want to add a new line, the previous line must end with a `,`. For all the car names that the game uses please see the `names.json` file inside of this repo to find the name you wish to edit.

## New Cars
Please submit a issue for any new cars and what you think/know they are.
